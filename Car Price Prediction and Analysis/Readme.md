### **Car Price Prediction: Key Drivers of Vehicle Valuation**  

#### **Overview**  
Independently conducted an end-to-end analysis on a dataset containing 26 features and 205 records related to car prices and their specifications. This involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and developing a predictive model. Despite a limited dataset, the model achieved a strong **R² score of 0.85**, effectively identifying the key factors influencing car prices.  

#### **Key Insights & Business Implications**  
1. **Top 5 Factors Influencing Car Price:**  
   - **Number of cylinders** in the engine  
   - **Engine type** (DOHC, OHCV, etc.)  
   - **Engine location** (rear vs. front)  
   - **Fuel type** (gas vs. diesel)  
   - **Fuel system** (MPFI, IDI, etc.)  

2. **Impact of Cylinder Count on Price:**  
   - Cars with higher cylinder counts tend to have significantly higher prices.  
   - Vehicles with fewer than **8 cylinders** have a **62% lower average price** compared to **8- and 12-cylinder** models.  

3. **Engine Type & Pricing:**  
   - Cars with **DOHCV engines** have the highest median price, followed by **OHCV, DOHC, and others** in descending order.  

4. **Engine Location Matters:**  
   - **Rear-engine vehicles** are priced nearly **twice as high** as front-engine counterparts, suggesting a premium for performance-focused or luxury models.  

5. **Fuel Type Influence:**  
   - **Diesel-powered cars** command a **38% higher median price** than gasoline vehicles, likely due to efficiency and durability factors.  

6. **Fuel System Pricing Hierarchy:**  
   - Multi-Point Fuel Injection (**MPFI**) systems correspond to the highest median price, followed by **IDI, MFI, 4BBL, SPFI, SPDI, 2BBL, and 1BBL**.  

#### **Conclusion & Business Takeaways**  
This analysis highlights key pricing drivers in the automotive market. **Performance-oriented features** (higher cylinder count, premium engine types, and rear-engine placement) significantly increase a vehicle’s value, making them critical considerations for manufacturers targeting high-end segments. Additionally, **diesel engines and advanced fuel systems** are associated with higher pricing, indicating potential demand for fuel-efficient, long-lasting vehicles.  

These insights can support **automakers, dealerships, and buyers** in making informed decisions about pricing, vehicle valuation, and market positioning. Further analysis with a larger dataset could refine these findings for even greater predictive accuracy.
